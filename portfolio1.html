            <h5>
            <br>
            Through my pursuit of lifelong growth, I have come to realize that self-doubt and fear are the only roadblocks to our success. 
            Consequently, my mission is summarized with the idea that “Everything we’ve ever wanted is on the other side of fear.”
            I am currently a student at the <a href="https://umich.edu">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a> studying Computer Science with a concentration in Business Administration. 
            My various experiences, especially my pursuit of excellence in the sport of swimming, have taught me the value of perseverance in the face of adversity 
            and I am extremely passionate about having a growth mindset and pursuing opportunities to become a leader of beneficial consequence to our communities</a>
