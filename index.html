            <br>
            Through my pursuit of lifelong growth, I have come to realize that self-doubt and fear are the only roadblocks to our success. 
            Consequently, my mission is summarized with the idea that “Everything we’ve ever wanted is on the other side of fear.”
            I am currently a student at the <a href="https://umich.edu">University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a> studying Computer Science with a concentration in Business Administration. 
            My various experiences, especially my pursuit of excellence in the sport of swimming, have taught me the value of perseverance in the face of adversity 
            and I am extremely passionate about having a growth mindset and pursuing opportunities to become a leader of beneficial consequence to our communities</a>

                PLTW + Garver Engineering Firm Capstone Project
                <br>
                <br>Aug 2019 – May 2020
                <br>
                <br>The purpose of our group's capstone project was to create a solution to a problem in the world and utilize research to prove its usefulness and eventually build that product into existence and present it to a panel of judges from Garver Engineering Firm in Frisco, TX. 
                    Our research included: the problem itself through scholarly journals and articles, the statistical impact of that specific issue (mostly in the United States), previous similar products that address that issue if any, the consumer sentiment analysis of said products, existing patent evaluation and research, laws surrounding said issue, research on the underlying concepts and science that make our proposed solution viable, market evaluations and surveys on the possibility of our innovation, and finally the market price of such a product and marketing that would allow for the best incubation process into an established product. 
                    However, the results of our research were not the only important part of the process; to be able to prove our results as factual and lacking fallacy, we had to be able to evaluate our sources as factual sources with accurate findings to be able to prove that the research that supports our product is viable, and not manufactured. By the end of this process, we were able to build and present our end result: a wearable teaching aid for sign language teachers at any level of academia, in the form of gloves with an LED circuit system with a wireless controller that aids in making the learning and teaching process much more efficient for both teacher and student, all in order to try and close the gap between the almost 11 million deaf people in this country with the 500,000 people that can communicate with them in sign language.
